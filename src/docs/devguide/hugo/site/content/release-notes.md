This page describes changes to the Giftcard Service Interface implemented across different releases of the interface.

## v3.2.0

Released 22 January 2018

- Updated Giftcard Service Interface to make use of base interface v3.5.0 to include new TranTypes and AccountTypes for Transactions.


## v3.1.0

Released 15 January 2018

- Align with v3.4.0 of base interface spec
- Donâ€™t re-declare slipData in ActivationResponse

## v3.0.3

Released 06 March 2017

- Remove incorrect calls to AsyncResponse.resume in resources classes.

## v3.0.2

Released 06 March 2017

- Updated Giftcard Service Interface abstract resource classes. The classes were changed to pass all parameters to the User's custom resource implementation, as opposed to resuming the AsyncResponse from within the resource. The User should now call resume on the AsyncResponse. This allows for more flexibility, proper asynchronicity and allows the user to choose their own threading model.
